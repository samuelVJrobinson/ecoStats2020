Notes for updating lectures:
- Oct 1, 2020: Intro to R lecture
  - Too long, took ~40 mins
  - First problem was fine, 2nd one probably too advanced (unless more examples shown)
  - Try to focus on _immediately_ practical techniques; programming must be immediately useful
  - Things to cut:
    - Lists (probably not necessary here)
    - Matrices (move to Lecture 2)
    - Motivation could take 1/2 time or less
    - Object/Function could be trimmed
  - Things to add:
    - Example re: working directory for reading csv files
    - Replacement example (i.e. how do I replace value x in column y?)
