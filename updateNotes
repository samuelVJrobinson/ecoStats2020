Notes for updating lectures:
* Oct 1, 2020: Intro to R lecture
  - Too long, took ~40 mins
  - First problem was fine, 2nd one probably too advanced (unless more examples shown)
  - Try to focus on _immediately_ practical techniques; programming must be immediately useful
  - Things to cut:
    - Lists (probably not necessary here)
    - Matrices (move to Lecture 2)
    - Motivation could take 1/2 time or less
    - Object/Function could be trimmed
  - Things to add:
    - Example re: working directory for reading csv files
    - Replacement example (i.e. how do I replace value x in column y?)
* Oct 8, 2020: Linear models lecture 1
  - OK length, took ~30 mins
  - Qs: how do we do this for 3+ variables? (Answer next week)
  - Talk along with bullet points, don't preempt (takes longer)
  - Exercise was OK, but make sure everyone is keeping up
* Oct 15, 2020: Linear models lecture 2
  - OK time, took ~30 mins
  - Consider better example for independent effects example:
    - "a"
  - Consider better example for effects plot: maybe show a 3D plot so limits of plotting are clear?
* Oct 23, 2020: Model validation
  - A bit too long, 35-40 mins
  - Could probably chop out reference to GLMs (not necessary yet?)
* Oct 29, 2020: ggplot
  - OK time, about 30 mins
  - Might help to have staged exercises in the future (ie. learn a bit, code a bit, repeat), or even split into 2 lectures, simply due to the hierarchical nature of ggplot
  - People were VERY interested in maps! Future lecture?
* Nov 5, 2020: dplyr/tidyr
  - Took longer, maybe 50 mins in total. Probably should just plan for a longer time period, since the material is fairly heirarchical.
  - Mini-exercises are good, but probably could be shorter and more compact if done in a lecture (would be OK as lab exercises, though)
  - Live code demos would be good, esp. for multi-line pipes (hard to see what's going on in the middle of the pipe)
* Nov 19, 2020: intro to common distributions
  - A bit too long, ~40 mins, but exercise was fairly short
  - "What distribution should I use" exercise was OK, but binomial vs poisson was kind of tricky - remind them about number of trials for binomial
  - Could cut down on math material, and emphasize how the distributions look using different sets of parameters
  - Might help to do live coding demo at the end, since getting generated data into a dataframe is a bit of a stretch for some
  - "Homework" idea: think of some of the things you've measured, and figure out what distribution they might follow. 
  
Other ideas:
- Could also do slightly (10 min) longer lecture, then assign "homework"
- Need to mention somewhere that packages need to be re-loaded every time you restart R
