Notes for updating lectures:
- Oct 1, 2020: Intro to R lecture
  - Too long, took ~40 mins
  - First problem was fine, 2nd one probably too advanced (unless more examples shown)
  - Try to focus on _immediately_ practical techniques; programming must be immediately useful
  - Things to cut:
    - Lists (probably not necessary here)
    - Matrices (move to Lecture 2)
    - Motivation could take 1/2 time or less
    - Object/Function could be trimmed
  - Things to add:
    - Example re: working directory for reading csv files
    - Replacement example (i.e. how do I replace value x in column y?)
- Oct 8, 2020: Linear models lecture 1
  - OK length, took ~30 mins
  - Qs: how do we do this for 3+ variables? (Answer next week)
  - Talk along with bullet points, don't preempt (takes longer)
  - Exercise was OK, but make sure everyone is keeping up
