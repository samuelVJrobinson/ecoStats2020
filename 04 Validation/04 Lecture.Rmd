## Motivation 

- Are my model results reliable?
  - Residual checks
  - Transformations
  - Scaling
  - Collinearity
- How do I tell if terms are important or not?
  - Drop-1 ANOVA
  - Wald t-tests
- How much stuff should I put into my model?
  - Causal modeling vs Machine learning
  - Avoiding a fishing expedition (model weights, stepwise selection)
